# Resume Setup Note

The resume image should be placed in the `public` folder as `resume.png` for the download functionality to work properly.

The uploaded resume image from the chat should be saved as:
- `public/resume.png`

This will enable:
1. Header "Resume" button to open the resume in a new tab
2. Hero "Download Resume" button to download the resume file
